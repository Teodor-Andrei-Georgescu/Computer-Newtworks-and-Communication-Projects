Project Overview
	This Python program is designed to analyze IP datagram traces generated by the `traceroute` program, focusing on key components of the IP protocol. 
	The program extracts and analyzes various attributes of datagrams, including intermediate nodes, fragmentation details, and round-trip times (RTTs).

Features
	1. Source Node Analysis:
	   - Extracts the IP address of the source node running the `traceroute` program.
   
	2. Destination and Intermediate Nodes:
	   - Identifies the ultimate destination node and intermediate nodes (routers) based on ICMP messages and/or UPD messages depending on if capture file is Linux or Windows.
	   - Lists intermediate nodes in order of hop count.

	3. Protocol Information:
	   - Determines the protocols used in the IP headers (e.g., ICMP, UDP).

	4. Fragmentation Analysis:
	   - Counts the number of fragments created for each datagram.
	   - Calculates the offset of the last fragmen for each datagram

	5. RTT Statistics:
	   - Computes the average and standard deviation of RTTs between the source and intermediate/destination nodes.

	6. Probe Statistics:
	   - Counts the number of probes per TTL.

How to Use
	1. Prerequisites:
	   - Ensure Python 3 is installed.
	   - The script requires a `.pcap` trace file captured from a `traceroute` session.

	2. Usage:
	   - Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:
	     	python P3_Fall2024.py <trace_file>

	     Replace `<trace_file>` with the path to the `.pcap` file.

	3. Output:
	   - The script produces a formatted table summarizing the analysis, including:
	   	1. Source node IP address.
	   	2. Destination node IP address.
	   	3. Intermediate nodes IP address.
		4. Intermediate nodes IP address in order of hop count.
	   	5. Protocol field values.
	    	6. Number of fragments for each datagram.
	   	7. The last fragments data offset value for each datagram.
		8. The average RTT between the source node and intermediate/destination nodes.
		9. The standard devation of RTT between the source node and intermediate/destination nodes.
		10. Number of probes per ttl.

Input Details
	- The input file must be a `.pcap` file containing captured IP datagrams from a `traceroute` session.
	- The script supports traces from both Linux (`UDP`) and Windows (`ICMP`) implementations of `traceroute`.

Oter Notes
	- Limitations:
	    - The script does not support non-standard `traceroute` implementations.
	    - Scipt heavily rely on the structure and integrity of the `.pcap` file.
	    - Script only Check IVp4 packets.

	- Testing:
  	    - The script has been tested with provided trace files for Assignment 3 and adheres to the output format specified in the assignment.
